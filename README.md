### Reference:
These projects are parts of the online course:
[The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.
With previous programming experience, this course is very helpful for me to understand the web development tasks and the toolkit avaliable.
The course introduces both the front-end and back-end development, with lots of hands-on practices. Topics include:

- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery
- Bash and Git
- Node.js
- Express.js
- API
- EJS
- Database and SQL
- NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

Recommend to anyone who wants to start web dev.
